# My Profile

## About Me

I am a prospective graduate student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Operations Research.

Previously, I was a rating analyst at a credit rating agency, where I spent over four years delving into financial contracts to evaluate the structural integrity of complex financial instruments. My areas of expertise during my time at the agency included securitized financial instruments and credit derivatives.

After observing firsthand the increasing emphasis on computer and quantitative skills, I decided to leave my previous job and focus on enhancing those skills as a full-time graduate student.

With my efforts at Georgia Tech, I am confident that I will become a true professional who can analyze financial transactions and products from legal, regulatory, and accounting perspectives, as well as measure and model them using quantitative methods.

## Focus Area

I will gear my efforts toward various techniques, including but not limited to simulation, stochastic models, probabilistic models, optimization, and their financial applications, during graduate school.

My GitHub is in its nascent stage now, but I strongly believe it will exponentially grow into something that truly matters.
