### Introduction

I am a prospective graduate student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Operations Research.

Previously, I had been a rating analyst at a credit rating agency, where I spent over four years delving into financial contracts to evaluate the structural integrity of complex financial instruments. My areas of expertise during my time at the agency included securitized financial instruments and credit derivatives.

After observing firsthand the increasing emphasis on computer and quantitative skills, I decided to take the plunge; leave my previous job and focus on enhancing those skills as a full-time graduate student.
